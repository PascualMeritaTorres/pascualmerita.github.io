title: "A bit about me"
---

I am a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Edinburgh. Currently, I am writing my thesis on 'Adaptive Pruning and Merging in Vision Transformers' under the supervision of [Dr. Edoardo Maria Ponti](https://ducdauge.github.io) and [Piotr Nawrot](https://piotrnawrot.github.io/). Thanks to them, I am slowly beginning to learn how to compare apples with apples (more on this here!)

My interest in Computer Science began around the age of 15, when I started programming my own VST music plugins on Ableton. It was just basic stuff like filters and equalisers. However, I also implemented an RNN that took MIDI as input and generated the next note, and I guess we can say that's when my interest in AI began. I then moved to the UK to study Computer Science at King's College London, where I developed a "Content-based Music Recommendation System" for my thesis under the supervision of  [Dr. Jeroen Keppens](https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/jeroen.keppens/) and with guidance from [Dr. Timothy Greer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timothy-greer-ph-d-28630671/).

My heart still lies in the intersection of music and deep learning, but I am getting more and more interested in helping make generative AI more efficient. That is everything I think of nowadays.
