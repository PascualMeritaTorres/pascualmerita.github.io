I am a first year PhD student with the UK Research & Innovation Centre for Doctoral Training in Natural Language Processing at the University of Edinburgh. I am fortunate to be supervised by [Edoardo Maria Ponti](https://ducdauge.github.io) and [Ivan Titov](http://ivan-titov.org). I am part of the [EdinburghNLP](https://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk) group. 

My research focuses on improving the efficiency and performance of neural models. I am also interested in language grounding and multimodal learning.

Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Warsaw. I also interned as AI researcher at [Meta AI](https://ai.facebook.com) in Paris, and as DL&Algo engineer at [Nvidia](https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/) in Warsaw. Finally, I worked as a Student Researcher at the University of Wrocław, under the supervision of [Jan Chorowski](https://sites.google.com/a/cs.uni.wroc.pl/jch/home/about) and [Adrian Łańcucki](https://scholar.google.pl/citations?user=gydbYxkAAAAJ&hl=en).
